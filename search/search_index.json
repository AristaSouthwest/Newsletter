For starters, there can be a wide range of devices deployed in a network, many of which are running various versions of code. Bugs and Security Advisories are unpredictable, and keeping track of them across a wide range of devices and code can become cumbersome. Failing to bring devices into compliance can result in network downtime, outages, and a vulnerable network.   </p> <p>The Compliance Overview section of CloudVision makes managing and maintaining a secure production network simple and straightforward. Once EOS devices are onboarded into CloudVision, they are automatically included in the compliance overview section. CloudVisions Bug and Security Advisory database can be automatically updated by syncing with Arista's AlertBase server within the Settings &gt; Compliance Update section of CloudVision. Once the AlertBase server is synced, you can view any new and existing Bugs and CVE's present on your EOS infrastructure. A table will be auto-populated:    </p> <p>  CloudVision view of bugs </p> <p>  First 3 columns zoomed in </p> <p>  Last 3 columns zoomed in </p> <p>The table will inform you of the following information:  </p> <ul> <li>The Bug/CVE identifier number</li> <li>A brief summary of the Bug/CVE</li> <li>The associated severity level</li> <li>The total number of affected devices and the exact devices that are affected</li> <li>The version of code that the Bug/CVE was introduced in as well as the version of code that it was fixed in  </li> </ul> <p>Levering this information makes monitoring and maintaining a secure and compliant network a seamless experience. By staying up to date on Bug and Security Advisories affecting devices in your production network, you can avoid network downtime all while ensuring your network is secure. Having one central location to view a list of all affected platforms and the remediation methods for them saves network operators time and energy.   </p> <p>Arista devices use a single operating system, EOS, across all network domains. This further adds to the simplicity of managing and remediating various Bugs and CVE's on our infrastructure, since they are limited to affecting one single operating system instead of many operating systems across devices in various network domains. EOS has historically been, and continues to be, an extremely high quality operating system, as illustrated in the image below.  </p> <p> </p> <p>To learn more about additional features of CloudVisions Compliance Overview section, like image and configuration compliance as well as End of Life information, click on the link below:  </p> <p>CloudVision Compliance Overview </p>"},{"location":"#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!
