You might be wondering: why VeloCloud? VeloCloud has led in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for SD-WAN for 7 years straight. Using our Dynamic Multi-Path Optimization (DMPO) technology, VeloCloud is able to provide improved performance and resilience between corporate sites as well as between corporate sites and the cloud.  </p> Arista VeloCloud <p>What is DMPO </p> <p>DMPO is our overlay technology. DMPO allows us to measure loss, latency and jitter on WAN links in real time and in both directions independently. We then identify applications using Deep Packet Inspection and direct them over the best available bandwidth based on their performance needs. Realtime traffic can be directed to the WAN link with the lowest loss, latency and jitter and when those characteristics change, can be moved to the new best path, transparently to the users. Large file transfers can be spread across multiple WAN links of different speeds to use all available bandwidth without choking higher priority applications.     </p> <p>What about Cloud and SaaS applications? </p> <p>Most SD-WAN solutions work great between corporate sites where an SD-WAN device can be installed on both ends. As more applications move to the cloud, requiring an SD-WAN device on both ends becomes cumbersome. VeloCloud solves this by hosting gateways (VCGs) in major datacenters around the world. These hosted VCGs enable you to leverage the capabilities of DMPO from the branch to the front doors of all the major Cloud and SaaS providers without any additional effort.   </p> <p>While there are many other features in the VeloCloud portfolio, DMPO and the hosted VCGs provide two of the biggest differentiators for us. As a Systems Engineer that came over with the VeloCloud acquisition, I am excited about the future under Arista and the integrations that are taking shape. If you want to find out more about VeloCloud, I look forward to meeting with you and showing you what we can do.  </p> <p>For more information on Arista VeloCloud SDWAN, please select link below: Arista VeloCloud SDWAN </p>"},{"location":"#simplifying-campus-network-operations-with-cloudvision-network-hierarchy","title":"Simplifying Campus Network Operations with CloudVision Network Hierarchy","text":"<p>By: Alex Bojko, Advanced Services Engineer, Southwest Region    </p> <p>Managing modern campus networks can prove to be a challenging task that can feel overwhelming at times. Campus networks encompass large numbers of remote sites, each with unique characteristics and various devices to manage. In order to simplify the management of such a distributed infrastructure, Arista has introduced Network Hierarchy in CloudVision.     </p> <p>Overseeing such a deployment and gaining visibility into various sites and device connections is a difficult task to accomplish. When an issue arises, locating that issue and pinpointing it to a specific site can be an extremely difficult task. Configuration across sites can also be difficult to standardize and modify when needed.  </p> <p>Network Hierarchy is a feature meant to simplify campus network management, and was introduced to Arista CloudVision to help address these pain points at scale.  </p> <p>Network Hierarchy in CloudVision provides a logical, tree-like structured view that allows you to group devices together by location. Instead of a linear list of devices that are scattered across your infrastructure, Network Hierarchy provides an organized, simple to comprehend view that allows you to navigate seamlessly between campus networks that you manage using the tree-like structured navigation panel. This structure works at scale, making it easy to oversee and manage large deployments with many physical locations. Each Campus is organized within the hierarchy, with devices grouped by physical location and operational use.  </p> Network Hierarchy Page <p>Within each Campus defined in Network Hierarchy, statistics and metrics are displayed that provide a comprehensive overview tailored to what is happening at each individual site. Metrics include statistics from both the wired and wireless side, Uplink health, MLAG Status, authentication information, connectivity monitor status, and a logical topology view of the Campus network.  This allows operators to quickly go from a global, network wide view, to a site/device specific, interface specific, drilled down view. Having this flexibility allows for faster MTTR, as issues are able to be isolated far more quickly and efficiently. Operators can locate issues that are specific to a site, and from there drill down to determine the exact device or devices experiencing the issues.  </p> Network Hierarchy Port Specific View <p>Network Hierarchy also allows for access layer interface configuration via the Access Interface Configuration Quick Action in CloudVIsion. Here, the operator can rapidly assign access layer port configuration to individual or groups of interfaces. This further simplifies day 2 operations, as any campus device switchport configuration can be viewed and modified as needed, all from the Network Hierarchy view.  </p> <p>To learn more about Network Hierarchy, the metrics it provides, how to run diagnostics, and how it can simplify your Campus network management, click the link below.
