The previous answer of \u2018throw more bandwidth at it\u2019, is being pushed to the limit as AI continues to place demands on the network infrastructure. But how do you build a QoS policy that is dynamic and does not need to be amended each time you add a subnet? The answer is Arista Traffic Polices.   </p> <p>What are Traffic Policies? </p> <p>In the most simple definition, a Traffic Policy allows the user to configure rules to match on certain packets through the packet processing pipeline. In the context of QoS Polices, Traffic Polices allow us to match on certain criteria, maybe a field-set field-set TOI link that we created to match various subnets from certain BGP peers, and then take an action on the packets contained in the match criteria, by setting a DSCP value and/or a transit queue.   </p> <p>As you can see in this TOI Link, by using traffic policies in conjunction with BGP, we can get away from ACL based matching criteria and statically configured IP prefix matches, and instead leverage BGP to manage the IP prefix field sets, to use within our traffic policy.    </p> <p>A Brief Example of Using Traffic Policies to set DSCP Values </p> <p>In order to show how traffic policies can be used, I set up a quick lab, using some Arista Devices in a Typical Spine/Leaf Configuration. I have (2) sets of Leaf or ToR switches, each connected to an ESXI host that has various Linux Virtual Machines. I prefer to use Linux as it is easier to verify traffic using TCPDUMP.   </p> <p>The diagram below shows the layout of the Lab that I am using (please note, while there is an MLAG shown in the diagram, I am not using MLAG for this lab):  </p> Lab <p>Using this lab, I tested various scenarios and configurations, but for the purpose of this article, we will focus on setting the DSCP value via a Dynamic Field-Set, using BGP Communities. My goal is to use the \u2018B\u2019 Leafs, which will be the ingress leaf in this traffic flow, to set a DSCP value of 48 on all packets that are being sent to 172.0.122.0/24. This subnet is connected to the \u2018C\u2019 Leafs.   </p> <p>In the example configuration below, we will use a traffic-policy that references a field-set that is being sourced from BGP. This means that we can define a criteria in BGP, in this case matching upon a community (65104:22), and any routes that have this community will be matched to the PremiumPfx class in our traffic policy. With the traffic policy configured, we will apply it to the interface (See below configuration output):  </p> <pre><code>traffic-policies\n    field-set ipv4 prefix basic\n    source bgp\n!\n    field-set ipv4 prefix premium\n    source bgp\n!\nrouter bgp 65107\n   vrf default\n      traffic-policy field-set mappings\n         field-set ipv4 basic\n            community 65104:11\n         field-set ipv4 premium\n            community 65104:22\ntraffic-policies\n   traffic-policy transit\n      match PremiumPfx ipv4\n         destination prefix field-set premium\n         !\n         actions\n            set dscp 48\n!\ninterface Eth1\n    traffic-policy input transit\n</code></pre> <p>Now that this has been applied, we will source traffic from 172.0.121.11 (a VM attached to the \u2018B\u2019 Leafs) destined for 172.0.122.11 (a VM attached to the \u2018C\u2019 Leafs). In order to show the DSCP value being set (shown as tos 0xc0), we will compare the output of a tcpdump taken before applying the traffic-policy to the interface with the output of a tcpdump taken after applying the traffic-policy to the interface.   </p> <pre><code>lab@tp1202:~$ sudo tcpdump -i ens34 src host 172.0.121.11 -vvv\ntcpdump: listening on ens34, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes\n21:14:09.374584 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 61, id 48402, offset 0, flags [DF], proto ICMP (1), length 84)\n\nAFTER\nlab@tp1202:~$ sudo tcpdump -i ens34 src host 172.0.121.11 -vvv\ntcpdump: listening on ens34, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes\n21:15:24.006086 IP (tos 0xc0, ttl 61, id 22808, offset 0, flags [DF], proto ICMP (1), length 84)\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see, we were able to set the DSCP value on packets destined for a particular subnet, based upon a BGP community that is being advertised by the ingress leaf.   </p> <p>Summary </p> <p>Traffic Policies are a very flexible method for manipulating various aspects of your network. This same methodology could be used at the WAN edge, to mark inbound or outbound traffic based upon BGP attributes. You could use this to provide SLAs for certain applications in your data center, or even to police traffic coming from your campus. There are a multitude of use cases for this.   </p> <p>If you are interested in learning more about Traffic Polices, or would like to speak to someone about seeing a live demonstration, please contact your local account team.   </p>"},{"location":"#arista-virtual-lab-environments-an-opportunity-to-test-your-creativity","title":"Arista Virtual Lab Environments: An Opportunity to Test Your Creativity","text":"<p>By: Akashdeep Takhar, Advanced Services Engineer, Southwest Region    </p> <p>Reading about technical literature for new tools is great to stay ahead of the curve in the networking space, however the impact of the toolset is reinforced by testing it out. Our team can provide you the opportunity to test our EOS and CloudVision solutions in sandbox environments! We have two environments ready for you to use: Arista Test Drive (ATD) and Arista Cloud Test (ACT).  </p> <p>Arista Test Drive (ATD) gives you the ability to use a pre-built topology to test, break apart, and build different functionalities of a network environment through EOS. With 3 pre-built topologies, you have the ability to choose the one that is closest to your production network. This allows for you to replicate real life production to test new features out. Have an ongoing issue in your live network? Replicate it in your ATD instance to test possible fixes and to identify root causes. In addition to CLI accessibility, you also have the opportunity to become more familiar with CloudVision as well. Create changes, push configurations, and utilize our Studios feature to learn more about CVP\u2019s capabilities!  </p> Use Cases For Each Lab <p>What if the pre-built topologies are not similar to the topology you had in mind? That\u2019s where Arista Cloud Test (ACT) can help to fulfill that requirement. Arista Cloud Test creates a custom topology by taking the inputs from a YAML file to build out a topology of your choice. Included in ACT are also different device models to choose from. This allows for you to specifically choose which devices to deploy in your sandbox environment, further adding additional customability to test out features in EOS and CloudVision. You can also choose specific versions of CloudVision to use in your environment. Essentially, you can build out a digital twin of your live production to test out features and troubleshoot problems by replication in the lab environment. Debating to use new features or make changes to production? Start by testing those actions within the lab environment to prevent issues or record issues that arise.   </p> <p>The opportunity to replicate your production, test out new features, or practice using Arista\u2019s solution are all possible thanks to Arista Test Drive and Arista Cloud Test. Contact your SE to learn more on how to obtain access to these labs.  </p>"},{"location":"#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!
