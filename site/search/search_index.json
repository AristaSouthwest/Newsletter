Extensive planning for an upgrade is typically required, as we need to ensure we have the right software version in place, a time window to execute the upgrade within, and a fallback plan in case things go wrong. When it comes time to perform the upgrade, depending on the scale of the infrastructure, it can prove to be a very time consuming task.   </p> <p>Arista's CloudVision Software Management Studio is a new addition to Studios that streamlines the process of upgrading network infrastructure. The Software Management Studio greatly simplifies the formerly tedious and time consuming task of upgrading your network infrastructure. Here is how the process works:  </p> <p>You start by creating a new Workspace, opening the Software Management Studio, and selecting \"Add Software\". </p> <p>  Studios add software feature </p> <p>Software in this case can be an EOS image, extension, or TerminAttr image. You can download an image or extension onto your local device, then upload it into your CloudVision instance using the \"Local\" option, or you can download an image directly into CloudVision using the \"Cloud\" option.  </p> <p>Once the required images are in place, you simply add them to devices based on a tagging schema you have created. For example, if you are upgrading network infrastructure at a specific site, you can tag each device with that site name, and assign an EOS image or extension to that tag. Once completed, review and submit the Workspace, and execute the associated Change Control to apply the images to the device.  </p> <p>  Image assignment to device </p> <p>The Software Management Studio makes upgrading network infrastructure a seamless experience, all while reducing network disruptions and giving you time back in your day.  </p> <p>To learn more about the Software Management Studio, or CloudVision Studios in general, select the links below:  </p> <p>Links for additional information on Arista SWAG: Software Management Article CloudVision Studios Article </p>"},{"location":"#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!
